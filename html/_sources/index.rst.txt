.. Dictel io1212 and io1212hq

Introduction
===========================


Dictel's io1212 (and io1212hq) board is a robust input/output accessory board for the Raspberry Pi designed for quality and suitable for industrial applications. It includes 12x relayed outputs as well as 12x opto-coupled inputs.

All input and output lines include an LED to visually indicate whether the line is locically on or off.

Both input and output signals are powered by a source other than the Raspberry Pi. This power must be supplied through pins labeled ``GND`` and ``+5V``. In the case of io1212hq, the power can be optionally supplied through the USB-C port instead.
